# Stripe Prices API

Prices define the unit cost, currency, and (optional) billing cycle for both recurring and one-time purchases of products. Products help you track inventory or provisioning, and prices help you track payment terms. Different physical goods or levels of service should be represented by products, and pricing options should be represented by prices.

This approach lets you change prices without having to change your provisioning scheme. For example, you might have a single "gold" product that has prices for $10/month, $100/year, and â‚¬9 once.

## API Reference

### The Price Object

The Price object contains information about a specific price, including the product it's associated with, currency, and recurring billing information.

Key attributes:
- `id`: Unique identifier for the object
- `active`: Whether the price can be used for new purchases
- `currency`: Three-letter ISO currency code, in lowercase
- `metadata`: Set of key-value pairs for storing additional information
- `nickname`: A brief description of the price, hidden from customers
- `product`: The ID of the product this price is associated with
- `recurring`: The recurring components of a price (interval, interval_count, usage_type)
- `tax_behavior`: Whether the price is inclusive or exclusive of taxes
- `type`: One of `one_time` or `recurring`
- `unit_amount`: The unit amount in cents to be charged
- `unit_amount_decimal`: The unit amount in cents to be charged, with up to 12 decimal places
- `billing_scheme`: Either `per_unit` or `tiered`
- `created`: Timestamp when the price was created
- `tiers`: The tiers for this price (if `billing_scheme` is `tiered`)
- `tiers_mode`: The tiers mode for this price, one of `graduated` or `volume`

### Create a Price

```
POST /v1/prices

Creates a new price for an existing product.

Parameters:

- `currency` (required): Three-letter ISO currency code, in lowercase
- `unit_amount` (required): The unit amount in cents to be charged
- `active` (optional): Whether the price is available for purchase
- `nickname` (optional): A brief description of the price, hidden from customers
- `recurring` (optional): The recurring components of a price
  - `interval` (required for recurring): The frequency at which a subscription is billed (`day`, `week`, `month`, `year`)
  - `interval_count` (optional): The number of intervals between subscription billings
  - `usage_type` (optional): Configures how the quantity per period should be determined (`metered` or `licensed`)

## Best Practices

1. Create different prices for different billing models (e.g., monthly vs. annual)
2. Use metadata to store additional price information for easier querying
3. Choose the appropriate tax_behavior based on your tax requirements
4. Use nicknames to make prices more identifiable within your system
5. Be careful with price updates as most attributes cannot be changed after creation
6. Use tiered pricing for volume discounts where appropriate
